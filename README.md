Graduate course module: versioning, tidying, and sharing data

How to care for a dataset: versioning, tidying, and sharing your work

Many research projects begin with confusing multiple versions of data, manual data modifications, multiple versions of data, figures, code and papers. In this course we will practice some fundamental skills for managing a single research project. We'll learn how to track changes to your dataset using version control, keeping your project organized and easy to share. We'll learn the core principles of "tidy data", and practice cleaning and reorganizing messy data into a form ready for analysis. Most importantly, we'll practice automating and documenting this workflow using R scripts. By the end of the module, students will have some of the key skills necessary to do reproducible research that is ready to share with your collaborators, your committee, and the world.
