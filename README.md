Graduate course module: version control, tidying, and sharing data

Many research projects begin with confusing multiple versions of data, manual data modifications, multiple versions of data, figures, code and papers. In this course we will practice some fundamental skills for managing a single research project. We'll learn how to track changes to your dataset using version control, keeping your project organized and easy to share. We'll learn the core principles of "tidy data", and practice cleaning and reorganizing messy data into a form ready for analysis. Most importantly, we'll practice automating and documenting this workflow using R scripts. By the end of the module, students will have some of the key skills necessary to do reproducible research that is ready to share with your collaborators, your committee, and the world.

# Overview
In this class we are going to learn three essential skills

* Version control with git
* The principles of _tidy data_
* using R to clean and organize a dataset

# Outline

_still really confused about the timeline here -- how much time do I have, exactly?_

## First steps - 3h
* Introduction to version control with git 
* Introduction to github
* Introduction to R (how much of that is necessary?) and Rstudio

## Second steps (Strictly necessary?)
* Reproducible documents

## Data skills - 3h
* Data collection - where to put your data.
* Tidy data - one column per variable, one observation per row
* "long" vs "wide" format
* `tidyr` and `dplyr`

## Sharing data
* Collaborating on github
* Data archiving - Figshare, Dryad, KNB
* Licences.

# Assessment

During the course of the module, students will work with a dataset - preferably one of their own or one their advisor is OK with publishing. Alternatively/additionally I'll supply some fallback ones. By the end students will have a reproducible workflow in a project directory, where they show how the data, code and output (figure?) that they've produced. 

This project will be stored on github, and another student will be assigned to evaluate it. Both the student's project and their evaluation of peer's work will be assessed.

Students will be assessed based on:

* Identifying the problems or "messiness" in their original dataset
* Documentation of the process of cleaning, in both code comments and commit messages
* Quality of problem solving in designing their data cleaning process (can your peer reviewer understand you?)
* The tidiness or usability of the final dataset
* Reproducibility (can a peer reviewer repeat your entire workflow?)
